To send command type '!'
and one of the following:
x#
y#
z#
where # means distance in millimeters
(6.21371e-7 mile) on the x/y/z axis.

You can combine commands for the axes
to move them at the same time.
Just separate them with space.
You can also combine commands for
separate movement using semicolon ';'

Here are examples:
!x10 (moves head 10mm on the x axis)
!y-55 (moves -55mm on the y axis)
!x15 y15
(moves on the diagonal to the x15 y15)
!x15; y10
(moves first to the x=15, then y=10)

You can specify absolute position
by adding 'a' at the beginning of the
command:
!a x10 y0 z0
(moves to the point [10, 0, 0])
!a x10 (moves only axis X to [10])
