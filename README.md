## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
The aim of this project is to create a desktop app that allows twitch users to control a cartesian manipulator 
via a channel's chat using basic commands. These commands are displayed in command line interface stylised on 
BASH. There are windows for displaying instructions and tips, programmed path and real time simulation of  the robot
updated using messages from the actual robot which is equipped with a web cam to allow users see results.
